# Team Norms

## Interaction Modes

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

The three primary interaction modes are key concepts from [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts).

* Collaboration: working together for a defined period to discover new things (APIs, practices, technologies, etc).
* X-as-a-Service: one team provides, and one team consumes something "as a Service."
* Facilitation: one team helps and mentors another team.
