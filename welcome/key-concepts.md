# Key Concepts

## Tooling

* Find tooling that leads or guides your teams down a given well-defined path vs. tooling that caters to large organizations' "needs," stemming from problems that arise from Conway's law. The latter creates extensive, overly complex tooling that tries to solve everyone's problems. The former leads to a more stable, focused, and intuitive tooling designed to solve a reasonable set of problems.

## People Development

* Cultivate and develop a strong pool of talented individuals ready to take on work and grow within the organization. We need to have a collection of work available to these individuals that they can complete. For example, any issue created by a [service interface](https://github.com/osinfra-io/github-organization-management#service-interfaces) should be labeled as a [good first issue](https://github.com/orgs/osinfra-io/projects/1) and documented to make completion of the work possible within the individual's cognitive load.
