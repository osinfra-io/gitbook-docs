## Context and Problem Statement

A [Terraform module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) is a great resource for describing the architecture and keeping infrastructure as code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't\_repeat\_yourself). Open-source modules are published to [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules). Should we consume Terraform public modules or develop custom modules?

## Decision Drivers

* Developers at all skill levels should be able to contribute and maintain over time.
* The interfaces provided to the consumer should be simple and focused.
* Security and other policies should align with organizational requirements.
* Good balance between [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't\_repeat\_yourself) and [Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS\_principle).
* Align with Hashicorp [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop).
* Single testing framework.

## Considered Options

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Use Terraform public modules.</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>Development of custom Terraform modules.</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>Combination of both.</td><td>null</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Decision Outcome

Option 2: Development of custom Terraform modules to fit the needs of the organization and the skills of the employees&#x20;

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use Terraform public modules

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Positive Consequences" %}
* If the module meets all our requirements right now, we do not have to write or maintain any code.
* We can adhere to the DRY principle.
* Initially, they will speed up delivery.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Negative Consequences" %}
* If the public module does not meet our requirements now or in the future, we will need to fork and maintain the module or have developers who are comfortable submitting PRs publicly.
* The user base is too large, and the KISS design principle has been lost.
* The rate of change across such a large user base is likely to be higher than most organizations tolerate.
* Testing public modules locally and understanding the backend requirements can be confusing.
* Testing frameworks vary across modules.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Development of custom Terraform modules

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Positive Consequences" %}
* We can balance DRY and KISS.
* New developers are more comfortable submitting PRs and learning git within the organization's context.
* We have control over the interfaces.
* We can align with organizational security policies.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Negative Consequences" %}
* This will slow down the initial time to delivery.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Combination of both

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Positive Consequences" %}
* Initially, public modules will speed up delivery.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Negative Consequences" %}
* Another decision process would need to be developed around when to use each.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
