# Homebrew

## Why?

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) fits the need for a package management tool covering Linux and macOS, installing independently from system packages in its directory. It's easy to install, upgrade, and supports easy "clean-up" or removal, giving developers the ability to start fresh quickly in the situation where your local machine is not working as expected. Most open-source tools support Homebrew allowing for similar installation methods.
