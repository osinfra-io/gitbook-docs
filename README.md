{% hint style="success" %}
This is a working example of a documentation site for platform engineering and Infrastructure as Code using [GitBook ](https://www.gitbook.com/)that can be [forked ](https://github.com/osinfra-io/gitbook-docs/fork)and modified to fit your organization's needs. [Continuous improvement](https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/#relentlessly-pursue-continuous-improvement) of documentation is crucial, and we've found that keeping documentation as close to the developer as possible, usually in your [source control system](https://github.com/osinfra-io/gitbook-docs), is required to enable that.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)**</mark> is a development model for infrastructure that focuses on open collaboration applying relative lessons learned from software development practices that organizations can use internally at scale.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Infrastructure**</mark> is the set of systems and underlying resources that serve an organization and encompasses the services necessary for its teams and applications to function.

The term "<mark style="color:yellow;">**as code**</mark>," means applying the relative lessons learned in the software world to infrastructure. Some critical practices include source control and clean code for readability, changeability, extensibility, and maintainability, along with automated testing and continuous delivery.
