Open Source Infrastructure (as code) is a development model for infrastructure that focuses on open collaboration applying relative lessons learned from software development practices that organizations can use internally at scale.

**Infrastructure** is the set of systems and underlying resources that serve an organization and encompasses the services necessary for its teams and applications to function.

The term "**as code**," means applying the relative lessons learned in the software world to infrastructure. Some critical practices include source control and clean code for readability, changeability, extensibility, and maintainability, along with automated testing and continuous delivery.
