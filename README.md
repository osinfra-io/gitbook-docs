# Welcome!

> "All the good practices we've learned in the software world should be applied to infrastructure. Using [source control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version\_control), adhering to the [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't\_repeat\_yourself), modularization, maintainability, and using [automated testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test\_automation) and [deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous\_integration#Automate\_deployment) are all critical practices. Those of us with a deep software and infrastructure background need to empathize with and support colleagues who do not. Saying "treat infrastructure like code" isn't enough; we need to ensure the hard-won learnings from the software world are also applied consistently throughout the infrastructure realm." - [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com)

A site dedicated to implementing infrastructure as code (IaC) using a consolidated convenience over the best of breed approach. The success of IaC depends on organizational collaboration at its very core. The intent is to speak to as many people as possible by keeping the system simple and efficient.
