# Terraform Coding Standards

## Style Conventions

> The Terraform parser allows flexibility in laying out the elements in your configuration files. Still, the Terraform language also has some idiomatic style conventions, which we recommend users always follow for consistency between files and modules written by different teams.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can enforce these conventions automatically by running `terraform fmt`
{% endhint %}

* Align with the official [Terraform style conventions](https://www.terraform.io/language/syntax/style)
