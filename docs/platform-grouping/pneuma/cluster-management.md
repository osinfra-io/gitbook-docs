# Cluster Management

Pneuma provisions one GKE cluster per zone for every team that declares `platform_managed_project.kubernetes_engine_locations` in its Logos team spec. Each cluster has a regional control plane (HA across three zones) with nodes pinned to a single zone — keeping Istio's locality-aware routing within the zone and preventing cross-zone scheduling hot spots.

Clusters are named `{team}-{zone}` (e.g., `pt-pneuma-us-east1-b`) and filtered per environment: sandbox and non-production deploy two zones (one per region), production deploys all six.

## Namespace Provisioning

Teams declare `kubernetes_engine.namespaces` in their Logos team spec. Pneuma's onboarding workspace provisions those namespaces and for each one:

- creates a dedicated Workload Identity service account, and
- binds the team's GitHub Actions service account (from Corpus) as a namespace-scoped `namespace-admin` via RBAC.

This gives each team self-serve deployment into its own namespaces without access to other teams' namespaces or the cluster itself.

## Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `gke-cluster` | Regional GKE cluster with nodes pinned to a single zone. KMS-encrypted etcd, Workload Identity, CIS GKE Benchmark hardened, Fleet-enrolled. |
| `node-pool` | Managed node pool with auto-provisioning, auto-repair, and auto-upgrade |
| `fleet` | GKE Fleet registration for multi-cluster service discovery and ingress |
| `workload-identity` | Kubernetes-to-GCP service account mapping — pods authenticate to GCP without keys |

The zonal Authentik and agentgateway workspaces look up only their selected Pneuma cluster and use a single provider connection per zone. Other teams' clusters are not prerequisites for those workspaces; shared add-ons retain multi-cluster deployment.

## Sandbox Teardown

The manually dispatched `Sandbox Destroy` workflow tears down all team clusters in both sandbox zones, including `pt-pneuma-us-east1-b`; it is not a selective cluster pause. It refreshes main state without applying infrastructure changes, then removes agentgateway parameters before its runtime and Authentik configuration before its routes and server releases. Diagnostics are removed before Istio manifests, manifests before their controllers, and all workloads before onboarding namespaces and GKE clusters.

The workflow retains the main workspace and Corpus-managed infrastructure, including the Authentik Cloud SQL instance, so it does not eliminate all sandbox costs. Authentik configuration teardown removes managed identity-provider configuration from that retained database. Every apply retains its existing environment approval; never run sandbox deployment concurrently with teardown.

## Core Invariants

- etcd is KMS-encrypted at rest — `database_encryption` with `state = "ENCRYPTED"` is hardcoded in the GKE module.
- Workload Identity is enabled on every node pool — no static credentials for pod-level GCP access.
- Shielded nodes with Secure Boot and integrity monitoring are enforced on every node — no unverified boot path.
- Client certificate authentication is permanently disabled — `issue_client_certificate = false` is hardcoded.
- Dataplane V2 (eBPF) is hardcoded as the network datapath — no legacy kube-proxy on any cluster.

### Per-Zone Clusters with Regional Control Planes

#### Context and Problem Statement

Teams need dedicated clusters with independent lifecycles. A shared cluster couples every tenant to the slowest consumer's upgrade cadence and makes one team's misconfiguration everyone's problem.

The cluster topology must also work with Istio's locality-aware routing — spreading nodes across all zones causes cross-zone traffic by default.

#### Decision

Each team declares cluster locations in its Logos team spec under `platform_managed_project.kubernetes_engine`. Corpus provisions the GCP project; Pneuma provisions clusters for every declared location. Adding a cluster requires only a Logos change.

**Regional control plane with single-zone node placement.** Each cluster has a regional control plane (HA across three zones) but nodes pinned to one zone via `node_locations`. This keeps Istio routing zone-local by default and avoids cross-zone scheduling hot spots. Clusters scale by adding zones; each zone is independently upgradeable and recoverable.

**Five add-on layers.** The workload runtime is decomposed into independently deployed layers:

| Layer | Tool | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| [Cluster Management](./cluster-management.md) | GKE | Compute, networking, Workload Identity, Fleet enrollment |
| [Service Mesh](./service-mesh.md) | Istio | mTLS, traffic management, ingress |
| [Certificate Management](./certificate-management.md) | cert-manager | Istio CA, mTLS PKI via istio-csr |
| [Policy Enforcement](./policy-enforcement.md) | OPA Gatekeeper | Admission control and audit |
| [Observability](./observability.md) | Datadog Operator | Metrics, logs, and traces |

Each layer maps to a subdirectory workspace in `pt-pneuma`, deployed in order via GitHub Actions `needs` dependencies.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **One shared cluster per environment** — Rejected. Single point of failure; blast radius is the entire environment; cannot scale horizontally; creates cross-team upgrade coordination overhead.
- **Bundle all add-ons into one deployment step** — Rejected. CRD ordering constraints (e.g., cert-manager CRDs before Istio certificate resources) require explicit sequencing. Separate workspaces make the order visible and enforceable.

#### Consequences

- Zone failure is contained — other clusters continue serving
- Add-on upgrades apply per cluster without touching cluster infrastructure
- Teams add or change clusters via Logos only — no `pt-pneuma` changes required
- Adding a zone requires claiming a CIDR slot from the Corpus IPAM plan

### Centralized Namespace Provisioning with Per-Team RBAC

  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Accepted ✅</td><td>July 2026</td><td>Pneuma</td></tr>

#### Context and Problem Statement

Namespace provisioning needs a single source of truth. Letting each team manage namespaces from its own repo would fragment cluster credentials across many pipelines and make cluster-wide invariants (naming, Workload Identity, ambient mesh enrollment) impossible to enforce.

At the same time, each team needs to deploy workloads from its own CI/CD pipeline without accessing other teams' namespaces or the cluster itself.

#### Decision

Pneuma centralizes all namespace provisioning in a single pipeline via per-cluster provider `for_each`. Teams declare namespaces in their Logos team spec; Pneuma creates them and grants each team scoped access through RBAC:

- A dedicated Workload Identity service account per namespace
- The team's GitHub Actions service account (from Corpus) bound as a namespace-scoped `namespace-admin`

Teams deploy into their own namespaces from their own pipelines. No cross-team access is possible.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Each team provisions namespaces from its own repo** — Rejected. Fragments cluster credentials across many pipelines and prevents centrally enforced invariants.
- **Grant each team cluster-admin** — Rejected. Violates inter-team trust boundary; any team could access every other team's namespaces.

#### Consequences

- Cluster-wide invariants (naming, Workload Identity, ambient mesh policy) are enforced in one place
- Each team can self-serve deployments into its own namespaces only
- Every namespace gets a Workload Identity service account; runtime GCP bindings are requested separately via the Nomos Agent
- The cluster set must reach zone workspaces as `TF_VAR_clusters` because provider `for_each` cannot read module outputs
