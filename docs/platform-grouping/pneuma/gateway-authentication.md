# Gateway Authentication

Pneuma enforces authentication and authorization for external application routes at the shared gateway. Teams declare route-level intent in Logos; Pneuma renders the required Istio and Authentik resources before traffic reaches a workload cluster.

## Architecture

Gateway auth runs on the Pneuma gateway data plane (`gateway-istio`). It combines Authentik browser-session enforcement, Istio JWT validation for API clients, and Envoy external authorization so application teams do not need to operate an ingress authentication stack.

Authentik is the platform identity provider. It is available at `authentik.<env>.osinfra.io`; production omits the environment segment. The `pt-pneuma` `authentik` and `authentik-config` workspaces deploy and configure it through `pt-arche-kubernetes-authentik`. Authentik stores persistent data in Cloud SQL PostgreSQL, and its embedded outpost provides the Envoy `ext_authz` endpoint for browser sessions.

Browser identity does not reach the workload as a bearer JWT. After the embedded outpost authorizes the session, the gateway forwards trusted Authentik identity headers such as `x-authentik-username`, `x-authentik-email`, `x-authentik-name`, `x-authentik-uid`, `x-authentik-groups`, and `x-authentik-entitlements`. Workloads behind a `browser` route use these gateway-controlled headers when they need the signed-in user's identity.

## Components

| Component | Owner | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Logos `route_auth_policies` | Logos | Source of truth for route-level auth intent. Policies are keyed by an existing route name. |
| Authentik | Pneuma via Arche | Platform OIDC provider and identity layer deployed on the gateway clusters. |
| Embedded outpost | Pneuma via Arche | Forward-auth endpoint for browser sessions. Istio registers it as the `authentik` external authorization provider and forwards its trusted `x-authentik-*` identity headers to authorized workloads. |
| Authentik applications and policies | Pneuma via Arche | Per-host application, proxy provider, and policy bindings generated from browser-route group and role requirements. |
| Istio `RequestAuthentication` | Pneuma | Validates bearer JWTs against the Authentik issuer and JWKS. |
| Istio `AuthorizationPolicy` | Pneuma | Sends browser requests to Authentik or enforces API JWT claims natively. |

## Request Flow

1. Cloud Armor evaluates edge security policy.
2. TLS terminates at the shared gateway.
3. The route's auth mode determines enforcement:
   - `browser` sends the request to the Authentik embedded outpost, which validates the browser session and returns trusted `x-authentik-*` identity headers for the upstream request.
   - `api-jwt` has Istio validate the bearer JWT against the Authentik JWKS, then evaluates the validated principal and claims.
   - `public` skips auth enforcement.
4. Gateway API routes Authentik callbacks to the embedded outpost and application traffic to the team service.
5. Mesh mTLS and workload authorization protect traffic after it enters the service mesh.

:::warning Fail-closed by default

Enforced routes do not fail open. Configuration with an unknown or incomplete auth mode is rejected before deployment. If the browser authorization service is unavailable, the gateway denies the request.

:::

## Auth Modes

Each `route_auth_policies` entry selects one of three modes. The default is `browser`.

| Mode | Purpose | Required fields | Forbidden fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public` | No authentication — the route is open | none | `audiences`, `public_paths`, `required_groups`, `required_roles` |
| `browser` | Interactive Authentik SSO for human users | at least one of `required_groups` / `required_roles` | `audiences` |
| `api-jwt` | Machine-to-machine bearer JWT validation | at least one `audiences` value | none |

For claim lists, matching is **OR within a list** and **AND across lists**. For example, a route with two audiences and one required role accepts either audience, but the role must also match.

For browser routes, Pneuma represents both `required_groups` and `required_roles` as Authentik group-backed policy bindings. Because Authentik forward-auth applications are host-scoped, every browser route for a team must use identical `required_groups` and `required_roles`; Logos rejects conflicting browser requirements across routes on the same team host. API JWT routes evaluate the corresponding `groups` and `roles` token claims directly.

## Browser Identity Headers

The browser contract ends at the trusted headers injected after Authentik authorizes the request. Applications must not expect an Authentik JWT on a `browser` route. The gateway authorization integration controls the `x-authentik-*` namespace so values supplied directly by an external client are not a trusted identity source.

Common headers include the authenticated username, email, display name, stable user ID, groups, and entitlements. Applications should consume only the fields they require and continue to rely on the gateway to enforce the route's declared group and role policy.

## Declaring a Policy

Teams declare auth intent in Logos beside the corresponding route. `route_auth_policies` is keyed by route name and is valid only in a mesh-enabled namespace.

```hcl
namespaces = {
  "api" = {
mesh_enabled = true

    route_auth_policies = {
      "api" = {
        mode            = "browser"
        public_paths    = ["/api/healthz"]
        required_groups = ["platform-engineers"]
      }
    }

    routes = {
      "api" = {
        path    = "/api"
        port    = 8080
        service = "api-service"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mode` | Optional. `public`, `browser`, or `api-jwt`; defaults to `browser`. |
| `audiences` | JWT audiences accepted by an `api-jwt` route. Required for `api-jwt` and forbidden for other modes. |
| `public_paths` | Unauthenticated paths beneath an enforced route. Entries must start with `/` and cannot be `/`, `/*`, or `*`. Append `/*` to a concrete path to exempt a subtree, such as `/api/healthz/*`. |
| `required_groups` | Authentik groups accepted by the route. |
| `required_roles` | Authentik application roles accepted by the route. |

Use the [Nomos Agent](/onboarding) to create or update the Logos declaration. Nomos validates the policy before opening the change.

## Browser Auth Limitations

:::caution Group membership is not synchronized

Pneuma creates the Authentik applications, providers, groups, and policy bindings required for browser enforcement. User membership is not yet synchronized from Google Identity or Logos. Users must be assigned to the required Authentik group. This gap is tracked in [pt-pneuma#181](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-pneuma/issues/181).

:::

:::caution Policies are scoped per host

Browser applications and policy bindings are scoped to a host, not an individual path. If two browser routes on the same host declare different requirements, Authentik's `Any` policy-engine mode allows a user who satisfies either policy to access both routes. This gap is tracked in [pt-pneuma#183](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-pneuma/issues/183).

:::

## Verification

The platform `istio-test` route exposes separate public probes and a protected browser-identity diagnostic:

| Request | Expected result |
|---|---|
| `/istio-test/health` without an Authentik session | Public health JSON response; no Authentik redirect |
| `/istio-test/metadata/cluster-name` without an Authentik session | Public metadata response; no Authentik redirect |
| `/istio-test/auth` without an Authentik session | Redirect to Authentik |
| `/istio-test/auth` after signing in as a member of `all` | JSON diagnostic showing the trusted `x-authentik-*` identity headers received by the workload |

The route uses `mode = "browser"` and `required_groups = ["all"]`. `/istio-test/health` and the metadata endpoints are explicitly included in `public_paths` so infrastructure health and metadata checks remain anonymous. These public checks should return their application response directly; a redirect to Authentik means the public-path bypass is not working. `/istio-test/auth` is intentionally protected and makes the browser identity handoff observable without requiring another application to implement a diagnostic endpoint.

OAuth callback requests under `/outpost.goauthentik.io` are routed directly to the embedded outpost on every protected browser host. This routing is required for the browser flow to return to the original application.

### Optional pre-sandbox checks

Developers can use `/platform-grouping:test-local-gateway-stack` for complex browser-auth and gateway configuration changes. This is an optional local integration workflow, not an additional CI or pre-push requirement.

The Kubernetes fixture exercises both direct Istio routing and the Istio-to-agentgateway-to-workload path, using the checked-out configuration modules. Full verification includes real Google sign-in, the trusted identity JSON, public-path bypasses, denial of forged identity headers, and ambient mTLS. An HTTP redirect alone does not establish end-to-end success. See [Module Development](../arche/module-development.md#optional-local-integration-tests) for the shared fixture convention and cloud-parity limits.

## Ownership Boundaries

| Boundary | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Application teams | Declare routes and auth intent in Logos; own application behavior behind the gateway. |
| Logos | Stores the team, namespace, route, and `route_auth_policies` contract. |
| Pneuma | Renders and operates gateway routing, Authentik, Istio auth policy, RBAC, and admission guardrails. |
| Arche | Provides the reusable `pt-arche-kubernetes-authentik` deployment and configuration module. |
| Techne | Provides schema tooling and the Nomos self-service workflow. |

## Operational Expectations

- Unauthenticated requests to enforced application paths are denied before reaching a team backend.
- The `istio-test` health and metadata diagnostics, Authentik callbacks, and other declared `public_paths` bypass enforcement without redirecting to Authentik.
- Route-auth changes deploy through the normal Logos-to-Pneuma pipeline.
- Pneuma owns Authentik availability, Cloud SQL persistence, and gateway auth observability.
- Browser authorization depends on current Authentik group and role membership.

## Core Invariants

- Auth intent is declared in Logos, not in team-managed gateway resources.
- Enforced routes fail closed.
- `browser` requires at least one group or role; `api-jwt` requires at least one audience.
- Public bypasses cannot expose an entire route using `/`, `/*`, or `*`.
- API JWT validation occurs at the gateway before authorization.
- Browser identity reaches workloads only through gateway-controlled Authentik headers after the session is authorized.

## Architecture Decision Records

### Centralized Gateway Authentication Enforcement

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Status</th><th>Date</th><th>Deciders</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Accepted ✅</td><td>July 2026</td><td>Pneuma, Logos, Techne</td></tr>

#### Context and Problem Statement

External team services need consistent authentication and authorization without every team operating its own ingress auth stack. If each team owned identity clients, forward-auth instances, Istio auth policies, and gateway resources directly, the platform would drift into inconsistent fail-open behavior and unclear ownership during incidents.

#### Decision

Centralize authn/authz at Pneuma gateway clusters. Logos remains the contract where teams declare route-auth intent; Pneuma consumes that contract and renders Authentik, the embedded-outpost ext_authz path, Istio JWT validation, and Istio authorization policy centrally. Arche packages the reusable Authentik module, and Techne provides the schema and Nomos authoring flow.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Team-managed gateway auth resources** — Rejected. Direct Kubernetes ownership would bypass the reviewed Logos contract and make route isolation, fail-closed behavior, and incident ownership inconsistent.
- **Per-application forward-auth proxies** — Rejected. Duplicates auth infrastructure in every app, complicates upgrades, and does not protect requests before they enter workload clusters.
- **Application-only authorization** — Rejected. Leaves unauthenticated traffic to reach teams and makes centralized denial observability impossible.

#### Consequences

- Teams get a self-service auth contract without owning gateway internals.
- Pneuma is the single operational owner for gateway auth availability, denial behavior, and observability.
- Schema validation in Techne and PR review in Logos become part of the security boundary.
- Gateway auth outages deny enforced traffic instead of failing open.

### Per-Host Browser Group and Role Enforcement

    <tr><th>Status</th><th>Date</th><th>Deciders</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Accepted ✅</td><td>September 2026</td><td>Pneuma, Arche</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Context and Problem Statement

`browser`-mode routes validated only that a user had an authenticated Authentik session — the declared `required_groups` and `required_roles` on a route's `route_auth_policies` had no enforcement path. Any authenticated user could reach a `browser` route regardless of group or role membership, because no Authentik application, provider, or policy binding existed to evaluate those claims for a specific host.

#### Decision

Pneuma's `authentik-config` workspace renders one Authentik application and proxy provider per gateway host plus policy bindings for the declared browser principals. Because the embedded outpost authorizes an authenticated session against that host-scoped application rather than re-evaluating application policies for every route request, all browser routes for a team must declare identical `required_groups` and `required_roles`. Logos and Pneuma validate this invariant and reject conflicting route policies instead of silently widening access.

The one remaining manual step — provisioning **Authentik group membership** itself from Logos/Google Identity groups — is out of scope for this decision and is tracked separately as [pt-pneuma#181](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-pneuma/issues/181).

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Manual per-route Authentik configuration** — Rejected. Requires an operator to hand-configure an application, provider, and policy binding in the Authentik UI for every enforced route, which does not scale, is not reviewable through Logos, and is easy to forget or get wrong.
- **Path-aware Authentik application policies on one host** — Rejected. The embedded outpost reuses its authenticated session for subsequent requests, so an application policy evaluated during authorization is not a reliable per-request path enforcement point.
- **Multiple single-application providers for the same host** — Rejected. Authentik selects forward-auth applications by host, so same-host providers cannot reliably represent distinct route policies.
- **Enforcing groups/roles entirely in Istio via JWT claims** — Rejected. Authentik's browser flow issues a session, not a JWT with claims usable by Istio's native `AuthorizationPolicy`; enforcement has to happen at the Authentik layer for interactive sessions.

#### Consequences

- `browser` routes with `required_groups` / `required_roles` are enforced consistently at the shared host boundary.
- Teams cannot assign different browser group or role requirements to routes on the same gateway host; they must align the requirements or use another auth mode.
- Authorized browser identity is forwarded to workloads through trusted `x-authentik-*` headers rather than an application-facing JWT.
- Adding or changing browser requirements remains a Logos change, but validation prevents configurations that the host-scoped Authentik model cannot enforce safely.
- Authentik group membership sync remains an open gap ([pt-pneuma#181](https://github.com/osinfra-io/pt-pneuma/issues/181)) — enforcement is only as strong as the manual group assignments behind it until that is resolved.
