# Organization Management

Managing thousands of repositories across hundreds of users in GitHub can become very complex and tedious. You'll want basic naming conventions for repositories and teams, ways to manage users in those teams, roles, and security settings enforced as a minimum. The [Terraform provider for GitHub](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs) allows us to manage our GitHub organization as a platform, just like any other infrastructure. Doing this will reduce technical debt when onboarding, provide ongoing supportability and provide a defined team interaction mode of [X-as-a-Service](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts).

This [repository](https://github.com/osinfra-io/github-organization-management) is an example of managing your GitHub organization using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and a set of [sensible default practices](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/sensible-defaults).
